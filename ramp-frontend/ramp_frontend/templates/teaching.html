                RAMP challenges begin with an interesting supervised prediction
                problem for which there is data. Domain experts then work with
                experienced data scientists to clean and curate the
                data and formalize the problem. This process can take two weeks to
                six months, and results in a 'starting kit', which typically
                consists of:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A jupyter notebook that introduces the predictive
                        problem, provides some background information, exploratory
                        data analysis and data visualisation, explains the workflow
                        and provides a simple example solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A 'problem.py' file that parametrizes the setup and uses
                        building blocks from <a href="https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow">
                        RAMP workflow</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data, split into training and test subsets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A requirements file detailing all the required software
                        packages.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                A challenge event can now be organised. These events may
                be part of a post-graduate level programme or a 'hackathon'.
                If the data science problem requires the mastering
                of a specific tool, the RAMP event can be preceded by a
                Training Sprint for explaining specific tools to the participants.
            </p>

            <p>
                RAMP data challenges has been used for teaching in many courses
                at various levels. Students usually love the platform for:
                <ul>
                    <li>its competitive gaming aspect,</li>
                    <li>being able to learn from each other in the open phase, and</li>
                    <li>to compete as a group with other student groups on the same problem.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                If you are interested in using the platform for teaching,
                We can open a new event for any <a href="/problems">
                RAMP challenge</a>. You will have full control over the users
                who can sign up for your event and the timeline the event
                (start, moving from closed to open phase and end).
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of your challenge we will give you a csv file with all
                the performance metrics of each student.

                <h1 style='font-weight: bold;'>Creating a new RAMP challenge</h1>
                If you have a predictive problem, you can work with us to
                develop a new RAMP challenge to incite data scientists to
                collaboratively prototype new models. We can then organize
                hackathons or longer data challenges, and use the problem in a
                classroom setting. We can also automatically benchmark the
                thousands of models that are already in the platform.
