Set up a new RAMP event
=======================

.. _deploy-ramp-event:

Deploy a specific RAMP event
----------------------------

Now we will want to deploy a specific problem and event. We will take an
example by deploying an ``iris`` event.

First, you need to get the starting kit and the data within the
``ramp_deployment`` directory::

    ~/ramp_deployment $ mkdir ramp-kits
    ~/ramp_deployment $ mkdir ramp-data
    ~/ramp_deployment $ git clone https://github.com/ramp-kits/iris ramp-kits/iris
    ~/ramp_deployment $ git clone https://github.com/ramp-data/iris ramp-data/iris
    ~/ramp_deployment $ cd ramp-data/iris
    ~/ramp_deployment/ramp-data/iris $ python prepare_data.py
    ~/ramp_deployment/ramp-data/iris $ cd ../..

Next, you need to create a configuration file for a specific event. You can
create this configuration file by executing the following command line from
the ``ramp_deployment`` folder::

    ~/ramp_deployment $ ramp setup init-event --name iris_test

The above creates a ``events/iris_test`` directory inside the deployment
directory, and populates it with a ``config.yml`` with the configuration
specific to the event.

This config file should look like::

    ramp:
        problem_name: iris
        event_name: iris_test
        event_title: "Iris event"
        event_is_public: true
    worker:
        worker_type: conda
        conda_env: ramp-iris
    dispatcher:
        hunger_policy: sleep
        n_workers: 2
        n_threads: 2

.. note::
    - <event_name> must always be preceded with the '<problem_name>_' as in
      the example above.
    - In the previous configuration example, we are using a conda worker. You
      can refer to the documentation about the :ref:`workers <all_workers>` and
      more precisely the :ref:`conda workers <conda_env_worker>` to have more
      information.


Before you continue make sure that:

    1.  Your private and public data are stored in the correct folders.

        For example, your data might be in:

        - public data: `ramp_deployment/ramp-kits/<problem_name>/data/`, and
        - private data: `ramp_deployment/ramp-data/<problem_name>/data/`.

        Note:

        - for more information on directory structure of the starting kits check
          `Overall directory structure
          <https://paris-saclay-cds.github.io/ramp-docs/ramp-workflow/dev/workflow.html#overall-directory-structure>`_

    2.  The conda environment (set in the ``config.yml`` file above, here
        called `ramp-iris`) used by your event exists. Note, that this only
        applies to the events which use the conda environment. To check which conda
        environments you have type::

        $ conda env list

Now, you can easily deploy the event (adding both problem and event to the
database) by calling from the deployment directory::

    ~/ramp_deployment $ ramp setup deploy-event --event-config events/iris_test/config.yml --no-cloning

Without passing ``--no-cloning``, it will try to clone the starting kit and
data from the https://github.com/ramp-kits/ github organization. If the
starting kit is located there, you can skip the first step of above of manually
cloning the kit and data and preparing the data, and let ``ramp setup
deploy-event`` do that for you.

Launch the dispatcher to train and evaluate submissions
-------------------------------------------------------

At this stage, you can launch the RAMP dispatcher from the ``ramp_deployment``
directory, which will be in charge of training, evaluating submissions, and
updating the database::

    ~/ramp_deployment $ ramp launch dispatcher --event-config events/iris_test/config.yml -vv

If you are running the dispatcher on a remote server, you want to launch it
within a terminal multiplexer as ``screen`` or ``tmux``. It will allow you
to detach the process and let it run. Refer to the documentation of ``screen``
or ``tmux`` to use them.


Launch several dispatchers at once
----------------------------------

In case that you are running multiple events in parallel, you will want to
start several dispatchers, on for each open event. We provide a daemon which
will be in charge of managing the pool of dispatchers. You can start it as::

    ~/ramp_deployment $ ramp launch daemon --events-dir events --verbose

To can interrupt the daemon by pressing the combination of keyboard keys
`Ctrl+C`. You can start launch the daemon within `tmux` or `screen` as well.
