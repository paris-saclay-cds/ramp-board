You might be interested in displaying some images (logos) in the ``Powered by``
section in the very bottom of your RAMP webpage.

To do so, add all the images you wish to have displayed to the following
directory::

    ~ $ ramp-board/ramp-frontend/ramp_frontend/static/img/powered_by

Your images must have one of the following extensions:

* .png
* .jpg (.jpeg)
* .gif
* .svg

When you reload your RAMP page the new ``Powered by`` section should appear.
