Develop and contribute
########################

Welcome to the RAMP team. We are always happy to have new RAMP developers.

You can contribute to this code by making a `Pull Request 
<https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_ 
on Github_. Please, make sure that your code is coming with unit tests to 
ensure full coverage and continuous integration in the API.


.. _GitHub: https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-board/pulls


Install for development
-----------------------
To install RAMP please fallow :ref:`install guideline <install>` making sure 
that you use the ``make inplace`` option to install RAMP in developer mode.


Prepare database engine
-----------------------
Testing RAMP requires a database cluster, you need to create it similarly as 
described in :ref:`create database <set_database>` section. 

If you haven't done so already create the ``Postgres database cluster`` 
using the command::

    ~ $ initdb postgres_dbs

and then start it with::

    ~ $ pg_ctl -D postgres_dbs -l logfile start

Within your database cluster `postgres` database is created automatically.
`pytest` will use it to make and then drop the test engine. But it needs
to know who is the owner of your `postgres` database and therefore you 
need to inform RAMP tests about this.
To do this, open the ``db_engine.yml`` file located in the ``ramp-board`` 
directory. 
It should look as follows::

    db_owner: postgres

You need to change <postgres> to the owner of the `postgres` database. 

If you don't know who is the owner of your `postgres` database you can 
find it out by typing in your terminal::
    
    ~ $ psql -l

This command will list all of your databases along with their owners. 

Test
----
Each time before running the tests make sure your ``Postgres database cluster`` 
has been started. You can always start it using the command::

    ~ $ pg_ctl -D postgres_dbs -l logfile start

where `postgres_dbs` is the database cluster you created in the previous steps.

In addition, you might want to start an SMTP server to run all the tests.
If you don't run the server, some of the tests will fail because they cannot 
be run. To launch the server, execute the following 
command::

    ~ $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:8025 &

You are now ready to run the tests. You can do so using ``pytest`` from the root ``ramp-board`` directory::

    ~ $ pytest -vsl .

The above will only work when the packages were installed in development mode.
In the other case, you can test the individual packages with::

    ~ $ pytest -vsl --pyargs ramp_utils ramp_database ramp_frontend ramp_engine

Forking RAMP
============

The preferred way to contribute to RAMP is to fork the `ramp-board repository`_ on GitHub:

.. _ramp-board repository: https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-board

1) To fork the `ramp-board repository`_ click on the 'Fork' button near the 
   top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account 
   on the GitHub server.

2) Clone this copy to your local disk::

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/ramp-board.git
        $ cd ramp-board

3) Create a branch (called 'my-feature' below) to hold your changes::

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. 

.. note::
    Never work in the ``master`` branch!

4) Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version
   control. When you're done editing, do::

        $ git add <modified_files>
        $ git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with::

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the ramp-board repo,
and click 'Pull request' to send your changes to the maintainers for
review. This will send an email to the committers.

If any of the above seems like magic to you, then look up `Git documentation`_ 
on the web.

Contributing Pull Requests
==========================

It is recommended to check that your contribution complies with the
following rules before submitting a pull request:

-  Follow the coding-guidelines_ as for scikit-learn.

-  When applicable, use the validation tools and other code in the
   `ramp_utils` subpackage.

-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the title to describe
   the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description to
   ensure a link is created to the original issue.

-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample
   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.

-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` if the
   contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed review.
   Incomplete contributions should be prefixed `[WIP]` to indicate a work
   in progress (and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures). WIPs may be useful
   to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
   request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.
   WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a `task list`_ in the PR description.

-  All other tests pass when everything is rebuilt from scratch. On
   Unix-like systems, check with (from the toplevel source folder)::

        $ make

-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements
   to be accepted.

-  At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to
   references in the literature (with PDF links when possible) and
   the example.

.. _coding-guidelines: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines
.. _task list: https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments

You can also check for common programming errors with the following
tools:

-  Code with good unittest coverage (at least 80%), check with::

        $ pip install pytest pytest-cov
        $ pytest -vsl .

-  No flake8 warnings (which includes pep8 and pyflakes), check with::

        $ pip install flake8
        $ flake8 path/to/module.py

Filing bugs
===========
We use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   issues_ or `pull requests`_.

-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in
   appropriate code blocks.
   See `Creating and highlighting code blocks`_.

-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well
   as your Python, scikit-learn, numpy, and scipy versions. This information
   can be found by runnning the following code snippet::

    python
    import platform; print(platform.platform())
    import sys; print("Python", sys.version)
    import numpy; print("NumPy", numpy.__version__)
    import scipy; print("SciPy", scipy.__version__)
    import sklearn; print("Scikit-Learn", sklearn.__version__)
   
-  Please include a reproducible_ code snippet or link to a gist_. 
   If an exception is raised, please provide the traceback.

Documentation
=============

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,
reStructuredText documents (like this one), tutorials, etc.
reStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the
doc/ directory.

You can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate
the HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the doc/ directory.
Alternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the
documentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will
be placed in _build/html/ and are viewable in a web browser. See the
README file in the doc/ directory for more information.

For building the documentation, you will need 

    - sphinx_, 
    - sphinx_rtd_theme_,
    - numpydoc_,
    - graphviz_,
    - eralchemy_,
    - sphinx-click_,
    - matplotlib_.

.. _sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org
.. _matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org
.. _sphinx_rtd_theme: https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _numpydoc: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html
.. _graphviz: https://www.graphviz.org/
.. _eralchemy: https://pypi.org/project/ERAlchemy/
.. _sphinx-click: https://sphinx-click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

When you are writing documentation, it is important to keep a good
compromise between mathematical and algorithmic details, and give
intuition to the reader on what the algorithm does. It is best to always
start with a small paragraph with a hand-waving explanation of what the
method does to the data and a figure (coming from an example)
illustrating it.
