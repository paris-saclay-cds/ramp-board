.. _all_workers:

Notes regarding the RAMP workers
================================

The RAMP "worker" is the object responsible of actually running (training and
evaluating) a submission and returning back the results (predictions and
scores).
The workers are typically launched from a loop set up for a specific event on
the server. The worker can then run the submission either locally on the server
or on a remote machine.

The type of worker used in a certain event is specified in the ``worker``
section of the yml configuration file, using the ``worker_type`` key (see
:ref:`deploy-ramp-event`). Additional keys can be required depending on
the worker type.

Available workers:

* The :class:`ramp_engine.local.CondaEnvWorker` will run the submission in
  a specific isolated conda environment. This worker is specified as
  ``worker_type: conda`` and requires an additional key ``conda_env``
  specifying the name of the conda environment.

* The :class:`ramp_engine.aws.AWSWorker` will send the submission to an AWS
  instance and copy back the results. This worker is specified as
  ``worker_type: aws``, and for more details on the setup and configuration,
  see below.

* The :class:`ramp_engine.remote.DaskWorker` will send the submission to Dask
  cluster, which can be local or remote, and copy back the results. This
  worker is specified as ``worker_type: dask``. For more details on the setup
  and configuration, see below.

.. _conda_env_worker:

Running submissions in a Conda environment
------------------------------------------

As previously mentioned, the :class:`ramp_engine.local.CondaEnvWorker` workers
rely on a Conda environment to execute the submission.

For instance, if you would like to run the `Iris challenge
<https://github.com/ramp-kits/iris>`_, the starting kit requires numpy, pandas,
and scikit-learn. Thus, the environment used to run the initial submission
should have these libraries installed, in addition to ramp-workflow.

Subsequently, you can create such environment and use it in the event
configuration::

      ~ $ conda create --name ramp-iris pip numpy pandas scikit-learn
      ~ $ conda activate ramp-iris
      ~ $ pip install ramp-workflow

If you are using a ramp-kit from the `Paris-Saclay CDS
<https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_, each kit will provide either an
``environment.yml`` or ``ami_environment.yml`` file which you can use to create
the environment::

      conda create --name ramp-iris --file environment.yml

Alternatively, you can include an `environment.yml` file inside the `ramp-kit`
directory and use the following to install the environment::

      ~/ramp_deployment $ ramp setup create-conda-env --event-config events/iris_test/config.yml

You can update an existing environment with the following::

      ~/ramp_deployment $ ramp setup update-conda-env --event-config events/iris_test/config.yml

Event configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create an event config.yml (see :ref:`deploy-ramp-event`) and update the
'worker' section, which should look something like::

      ramp:
          problem_name: iris
          event_name: iris_ramp_test
          event_title: "Iris classification challenge"
          event_is_public: true
      worker:
          worker_type: conda
          conda_env: ramp-iris
          kit_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/ramp-kits/iris
          data_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/ramp-data/iris/data
          submissions_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/events/iris/submissions
          logs_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/events/iris/logs
          predictions_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/events/iris/predictions
          timeout: 14400
      dispatcher:
          hunger_policy: sleep
          n_workers: 2
          n_threads: 2
          time_between_collection: 1

**Worker configuration**

* ``conda_env``: the name of the conda environment to use. If not specified,
  the base environment will be used.
* ``kit_dir``: path to the directory of the RAMP kit.
* ``data_dir``: path to the directory of the data.
* ``submissions_dir``: path to the directory containing the submissions.
* ``logs_dir``: path to the directory where the log of the submission
  will be stored.
* ``predictions_dir``: path to the directory where the predictions of the
  submission will be stored.
* ``timeout``: timeout after a given number of seconds when running the worker.
  If not provided, a default of 7200 is used.

.. _conda_dispatcher:

**dispatcher configuration**

* ``hunger_policy``: Policy to apply in case that there is no anymore workers
  to be processed. One of `None`, 'sleep' or 'exit', default is `None`:

    * if `None`: the dispatcher will work without interruption;
    * if 'sleep': the dispatcher will sleep for 5 seconds before to check
      for new submission;
    * if 'exit': the dispatcher will stop after collecting the results of
      the last submissions.

* ``n_workers``: Maximum number of workers that can run submissions
  simultaneously.
* ``n_threads``: The number of threads that each worker can use.
* ``time_between_collection``: How long, in seconds, the worker should wait
  before re-checking if the submission is ready for collection. The default is
  1 second.

Running submissions on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
------------------------------------------------

The AWS worker will train and evaluate the submissions on an AWS instance,
which can be useful if the server itself has not much resources or if you need
specific resources (e.g. GPU's). To this end you need to prepare an image based
on which RAMP can launch an instance for each submission.

You can do so:

1. you can either create an AWS EC2 instance manually, install everything and
load the data and make an image from that instance (see
  :ref:`prepare_AWS_image`), or
2. make a pipeline with a recipe to create an image
  (see :ref:`prepare_AWS_pipeline`).

The latter option has an advantage if you forsee that the image will be updated
during the course of the running challenge (e.g. participants demand installing
additional Python packages). The first option will require altering the image
manually while the latter will update the image automatically by rerunning
the pipeline (RAMP will always select the newest version of the
image 'ami_image_name' (base name of the image) set in the `config.yml` file of
the event.

.. _prepare_AWS_image:

Prepare AWS image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please follow the summary steps:

1. Launch AWS instance and connect to it.
2. Prepare the instance for running submissions.
3. Save the instance as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
4. Update the event ``config.yml`` file on the RAMP server.

.. _launch_aws:

Launching AWS instance
""""""""""""""""""""""

Follow `AWS getting started
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html>`_
to launch an Amazon EC2 Linux instance. Amazon can create a new key-pair
for your instance, which you can download. You need to store this in a
hidden directory (e.g., ``.ssh/``) and change the rights to file permissions
to only read for owner. You can use::

      ~ $ chmod 400 <path_to_aws_key>

To connect to your instance via ssh, use::

      ~ $ ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem my-instance-user-name@my-instance-public-dns-name

`'my-instance-user-name'` depends on the type of instance you picked but is
commonly 'ec2-user' or 'ubuntu'. The full list can be found `here
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html#connection-prereqs-get-info-about-instance>`_
under 'Get the user name for your instance'. 'my-instance-public-dns-name' can
be found by clicking on your 'Instances' tab in your EC2 dashboard.
Full connection details can be found in the `AWS guide
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html>`_.

.. _prepare_instance:

Prepare the instance
""""""""""""""""""""

To prepare the instance you need to download the starting kit, data and all
required packages to run submissions. This can be saved as an AMI (image) and
will then be used to launch instances to run submissions.

Below is a basic guide for creating such an AMI manually, using the Iris
challenge. This guide is for an ubuntu instance. If you have a Linux instance
you will not need to add miniconda to your ``~/.profile`` but you will
need to install git.

  - Install miniconda::

        ~ $ LATEST_MINICONDA="http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh"
        ~ $ wget -q $LATEST_MINICONDA -O ~/miniconda.sh
        ~ $ bash ~/miniconda.sh -b
        ~ $ echo '. ${HOME}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh' >> ~/.profile
        ~ $ echo 'conda activate base' >> ~/.profile
        ~ $ source .profile
        ~ $ conda info
        ~ $ conda update --yes --quiet conda pip

  - Get the starting kit material (e.g. for 'iris')::

        ~ $ RAMPKIT_DIR="$HOME/ramp-kits"
        ~ $ project_name="iris"
        ~ $ kit_url="https://github.com/ramp-kits/$project_name"
        ~ $ kit_dir="$RAMPKIT_DIR/$project_name"
        ~ $ git clone $kit_url $kit_dir

  - Update the base conda environment for the needs of the challenge::

        ~ $ environment="$kit_dir/environment.yml"
        ~ $ conda env update --name base --file $environment
        ~ $ conda list

  - Get the data and copy private data to ``ramp-kits/<project>/data/``.
    Note: depending on how ``prepare_data.py`` structures the data files,
    the last command may differ::

        ~ $ RAMPDATA_DIR="$HOME/ramp-data"
        ~ $ data_url="https://github.com/ramp-data/$project_name"
        ~ $ data_dir="$RAMPDATA_DIR/$project_name"
        ~ $ git clone $data_url $data_dir
        ~ $ cd $data_dir
        ~ $ python prepare_data.py
        ~ $ cp data/private/* $kit_dir/data/

  - Test the kit::

        ~ $ cd $kit_dir
        ~ $ ramp-test

Next, save the instance as an AMI. Starting from the instance tab:
Actions -> Image -> Create image. See `Create an AMI from an Amazon EC2
instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/tkv-create-ami-from-instance.html>`_
for more details.

.. _prepare_AWS_pipeline:

Prepare AWS Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reference: `AWS guidelines
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/how-image-builder-works.html>`_

To prepare the AMI Image AWS Pipeline log in into your AWS account.

Follow the three steps:

1. create a components
2. create an image recipe
3. create a pipeline

Ad. 1 To create a component search for image pipelines and navigate to the
`Components` tab on the menu bar on the left hand side. Click a button 'Create
component'. Then select:

- 'Build' as component type
- type the name of the component
- component version (e.g. 1.0.0)
- Define document content. Here is the template of what you might want to use::

    constants:

                  echo "test end"

where you should exchange '$CHALLENGE_NAME' for the name of the challenge you
wish to use (here we are pointing to repositories stored on the ramp-kits
github repository), and '$USERNAME' and '$PASSWORD' for your
credentials on OSF where you stored the data for the challenge. Of course this
is just a suggestion. Feel free to make your own, custom file.

Note: If you prefer using S3 from AWS to store and load your data you can
follow the instructions on how to do that here:
`AWS configure envvars docs
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html>`_

You will need to create a new IAM user with the rights to access S1 and then
exchange the lines for download in your .yml file with::

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key_received_on_creating_a_user
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=key_received_on_creating_a_user
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=the_zone_you_use  # eg eu-west-1
    aws S3 cp --recursive s3://your_bucket_name_on_S3/


Once you have the component ready we progress to Image recipe:

Ad 2. Select the tab 'Image recipes' and then click the button 'Create image
recipe'. Fill in the name, version and optionally the description for this
recipe. Then select:

- Select managed Images
- Ubuntu (you might prefer to choose different operating system, but keep
  in mind that the default user may differ. For ubuntu it is 'ubuntu' for Linux
  it is 'ec2-user'. You will need to know your default user when writing the
  `config.yml` file for your event and/or to ssh to your instance)
- quick start (Amazon-managed)
- Ubuntu Server 20 LTS x86
- Use latest available OS version
- working directory path: '/tmp'
- if you have a large dataset consider increasing the memory, eg to 16 GiB

Next, choose the component. From the drop down list select 'Owned by me' and
select the component you created in the previous step.

Scroll down and click the button 'Create recipe'.

Ad 3. Select 'Image pipelines' from the left-hand side menu bar. Click the
button 'Create image pipeline'. Next:

- Choose the name for your pipeline and optionally the description
- Enable enhanced metadata collection
- Build schedule: Manual
- click 'Next'
- select 'Use existing recipe' and choose your recipe from the drop down menu
- click 'Next'
- Create infrastructure configuration using service defaults
- click 'Next'
- click 'Next'
- review your pipeline and press 'Create pipeline'

Congratulations! You have just created a pipeline for your ramp event. Let's
now run it making sure that everything works as expected.

To create an image select your pipeline and from 'Actions' select 'Run
pipeline'. You can also select 'View details' to follow creation of the
pipeline. Relax, it will take a while.

In case there is a failure when running your pipeline
you can search for logs on CloudWatch to view more precisely what has happened.

Once your pipeline is successfully created you can search for 'EC2'. There, in
the menu on your left-hand side you will find 'AMIs' tab. Click on it.

You should be able to find all your available images, also the one just
created. Note that if you run the same pipeline next time the new
AMI will appear with the same name but of different version. Ramp always
searches for the newest version of the image (as long as you specify the
correct base name in the config.yml file).

To make sure that everything works as expected it is advised that you create an
instance from that image and connect to it through ssh.
Check if all the expected files are there and that you can run the ramp-test
without issues. Also, if you wish to be able to use GPU make sure that your
python code recognizes them, you can also use the command::

  nvidia-smi -l 3

To make sure that your nvidia driver is correctly installed


Event configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create an event config.yml (see :ref:`deploy-ramp-event`) and update the
'worker' section, which should look something like::

      ramp:
          problem_name: iris
          event_name: iris_ramp_aws_test
          event_title: "iris ramp aws test"
          event_is_public: true
      worker:
          worker_type: aws
          access_key_id: <aws_access_key_id for boto3 Session>
          secret_access_key: <aws_secret_access_key for boto3 Session>
          region_name: us-west-2 # oregon
          ami_image_name: <name of the AMI set up for this event>
          ami_user_name: ubuntu
          instance_type: t2.micro
          use_spot_instance: false
          key_name: <name of your pem file, eg iris_key>
          security_group: launch-wizard-103
          key_path: <path to pem file corresponding to user name, eg my_path/iris_key.pem>
          remote_ramp_kit_folder: /home/ubuntu/ramp-kits/iris
          submissions_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/events/iris_aws/submissions
          predictions_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/events/iris_aws/predictions
          logs_dir: /home/ramp/ramp_deployment/events/iris_aws/logs
          memory_profiling: false
      dispatcher:
          hunger_policy: sleep
          n_workers: 5
          n_threads: 2
          time_between_collection: 60

**Worker configuration**

* ``access_key_id`` and ``secret_access_key``: to create a new access key, go
  to your top navigation bar, click on your user name -> My Security
  Credentials. Open the 'Access keys' tab then click on 'Create New Access
  Key'. You will be prompted to download your 'access key ID' and 'secret
  access key' to a ``.csv`` file, which should be saved in a secure location.
  You can also use an existing access key by obtaining the ID and key from
  your saved ``.csv`` file. See `Managing Access Keys
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey>`_
  for more details.
* ``region_name``: zone of your instance, which can be found in the EC2
  console, 'Instances' tab on the left, under 'availability zone'.
* ``ami_image_name``: name you gave to the image you prepared (see
  :ref:`prepare_instance`). This can be found in the EC2 console, under
  'Images' -> 'AMI' tab.
* ``ami_user_name``: user name you used to ssh into your instance.
  Commonly 'ec2-user' or 'ubuntu'.
* ``instance_type``: found in the EC2 console, 'Instances' tab, 'Description'
  tab at the bottom, under 'Instance type'.
* ``use_spot_instance``: boolean, default false. Whether or not to use spot
  instances. See `AWS
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html>`_
  for more information on spot instances.
* ``key_name``: name of the key, eg if your key file is 'iris_key.pem', the key
  name is 'iris_key'
* ``security_group``: in the EC2 console, 'Instances' tab, 'Description' tab
  at the bottom, under 'Security groups'.
* ``key_path``: path to the you private key used to ssh to your instance
  (see :ref:`launch_aws`). Note that you need to copy your key into the RAMP.
  It is best to give the absolute path. Ensure the permissions of this file
  is set to only 'read' by owner (which can be done using ``chmod 400
  key_name.pem`` command).
* ``remote_ramp_kit_folder``: path to the starting kit folder on
  the AWS image you prepared (see :ref:`prepare_instance`).
* ``submissions_dir``: path to the submissions directory on the RAMP server.
* ``predictions_dir``: path to the predictions directoryon the RAMP server.
* ``logs_dir``: path to store the submission logs on the RAMP server.
* ``memory_profiling``: boolean, whether or not to profile memory used by each
  submission. You need to install `memory profiler
  <https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/>`_ in your prepared AMI image
  to enable this.

.. _AWS_dispatcher:

**Dispatcher configuration**

* ``hunger_policy``: See :ref:`dispatcher_configuration`.
* ``n_workers``: Maximum number of workers that can run submissions
  simultaneously. For AWS workers, this means the maximum number of
  instances that can be run at one time. This should fall within your
  AWS instance limit.
* ``n_threads``: The number of threads that each worker can use. This would
  depend on the AWS instance type you have chosen.
* ``time_between_collection``: How long, in seconds, the worker should wait
  before re-checking if the submission is ready for collection. The default is
  1 second. For AWS workers the check for collection will be done through SSH.
  If the time between checks is too small, the repetitive SSH requests may be
  potentially blocked by the cloud provider. We advise to set this
  configuration to at least 60 seconds.

Running submissions with Dask
-----------------------------

:class:`ramp_engine.remote.DaskWorker` allows to run submissions on a Dask
distributed cluster which can be either remote or local.

To setup this worker please follow the instructions below.

DaskWorker setup of the main server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Setup the :ref:`ramp_frontend server <setup_server>` and
   :ref:`deploy the RAMP event <deploy-ramp-event>`.
2. Install dask.distributed,

   .. code:: bash

       $ pip install "dask[distributed]"

2. Start a dask.distributed scheduler,

   .. code:: bash

       $ dask-scheduler


   See `dask.distributed documentation
   <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/cli.html#command-line>`_
   for more information.

3. Specify the worker in the event configuration as follows,

   .. code:: yaml

     worker:
       worker_type: dask
       conda_env: ramp-iris
       dask_scheduler: "tcp://127.0.0.1:8786"   # or another URL to the dask scheduler
       n_workers: 4  # (number of RAMP workers launched in parallel. Must be smaller
                     #  than the number of dask.distributed workers)

4. Launch the :ref:`RAMP dispatcher <launch_dispatcher>`.

DaskWorker setup with a local cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start a local dask.distributed cluster, run

.. code:: bash

   $ dask-worker --nprocs 10  # or any appropriate number of workers.

See `dask.distributed documentation
<https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/cli.html#command-line>`_
for more information.

.. note::

   The number of dask.distributed workers (as specified by the `--nprocs`
   argument) must be larger, ideally by 50% or so, than the number of RAMP
   workers specified in the event configuration. For instance, on a machine
   having 16 physical CPUs, you can start 16 RAMP workers, and 32
   dask.distributed workers.

   This is necessary as some dask.distributed workers will be used for running
   the submission, while others manage data and state synchronization.


DaskWorker setup with a remote cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use a remote dask.distributed cluster, following pre-requisites must be verified.

- the remote machine must have a `ramp_deployment`
  folder with the same absolute path as on the main server
- it must have a `base` (or `ramp-board`) environment  with the same versions of installed
  packages as on the main server. Including the same version of `dask[distributed]`.


The setup steps are then as follows,

1. Create the conda environment for running event submissions (same name as on
   the main server).
2. Copy `ramp-kit` and `ramp-data` of the event from the main server, to the
   identical paths under the `ramp_deployment` folder.
3. Start the dask[distributed] workers,

   .. code:: bash

       $ dask-worker --nprocs 10  # or any appropriate number of workers.


   .. note::

      If the Dask scheduler is not in the same local network as the Dask workers,
      you would need to start workers as,

      .. code:: bash

          dask-worker tcp://<scheduler-public-ip>:8786 --listen-address "tcp://0.0.0.0:<port>" --contact-address "tcp://<worker-public-ip>:<port>


      This however only works with one dask worker at the time. To start more,
      you can use the following bash script,


      .. code:: bash

          # Select the number of dask workers to start.
          # Better to start at idx=10, to keep the number of digits
          # (mapped to the port) constant.
          for idx in {10..28}
          do
              # start dask worker in the background
              dask-worker tcp://<scheduler-public-ip>:8786 --listen-address "tcp://0.0.0.0:416${idx}"   --contact-address "tcp://<worker-public-ip>:416${idx}" --nthreads 4  &
              sleep 0.5
          done

          echo "Sleeping"
          while [ 1 ]
          do
              sleep 1
          done

          # On exit kill all children processes (i.e. all workers)
          trap "trap - SIGTERM && kill -- -$$" SIGINT SIGTERM EXIT


      which in particular allows to kill all workers with `Ctrl+C` when interrupting this script.



**Security considerations**

By default communications between dask distributed schedulers and workers is
neither encrypted not authenticated which poses security risks. Dask
distributed supports TLS/SSL certifications, however these are not currently
supported in DaskWorker in RAMP.

A workaround for authentication could be to configure a firewall, such as
`UFW <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW>`_ to deny connections to dask
related ports, except from pre-defined IPs of dask worker/scheduler.

.. warning::

   Do not run the following command without understanding what they do. You
   could lose SSH access to you machine.

For instance with the UFW firewall on the main server,

.. code::

   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # allow SSH
   sudo ufw allow 80
   sudo ufw allow 443      # allow access to ramp_frontend server over HTTP and HTTPS
   sudo ufw allow from <remote-worker-ip>  # allow access to any port from a given IP
   sudo ufw enable
   sudo ufw status


Create your own worker
----------------------

Currently, the choice of workers in RAMP is quite limited. You might want to
create your own worker for your platform (Openstack, Azure, etc.). This section
illustrates how to implement your own worker.

Your new worker should subclass :class:`ramp_engine.base.BaseWorker`. This
class implements some basic functionalities which you should use.

The ``setup`` and ``teardown`` functions
........................................

The ``setup`` function will initialize the worker before it can be used, e.g.
activate the right conda environment. Your worker should implement this class
and call ``super`` at the end of it. Indeed, the base class is in charge of
updating the status of the worker and logging some information. Thus, your
function should look like::

      def setup(self):
            # implement some initialization for instance launch an
            # Openstack instance
            assert True
            # call the base class to update the status and log
            super().setup()

Similarly, you might need to make some operation to release the worker. Then,
the function ``teardown`` is in charge of this. It should be called similarly
to the ``setup`` function::

      def teardown(self):
            # clean some jobs done by the worker
            # ...
            # call the base class to update the status and log
            super().teardown()

The ``launch_submission`` and ``collect_results`` functions
...........................................................

The actual job of the worker should be implemented in ``launch_submission`` in
charge of running a submission and ``collect_results`` in charge of collecting
and paste them in the location indicated by the dispatcher. As for the other
previous functions, you should call ``super`` at the end of the processing to
update the status of the worker::

      def launch_submission(self):
            # launch ramp test --submission <sub> --save-output on the Openstack
            # instance
            ...
            # call the base class to update the status and log
            super().launch_submission()

Once a submission is trained, the ``ramp test`` command line would store the
results and you should upload those in the directory indicated by the
dispatcher::

      def collect_results(self):
            # the base class will be in charge of checking that the state of
            # the worker is fine
            super().collect_results()
            # write the prediction and logs at the location indicated by the
            # dispatcher (given by the config file)
            log_output = stdout + b'\n\n' + stderr
            log_dir = os.path.join(self.config['logs_dir'],
                                   self.submission)
            if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
                os.makedirs(log_dir)
            with open(os.path.join(log_dir, 'log'), 'wb+') as f:
                f.write(log_output)
            pred_dir = os.path.join(self.config['predictions_dir'],
                                    self.submission)
            output_training_dir = os.path.join(
                self.config['submissions_dir'], self.submission,
                'training_output')
            if os.path.exists(pred_dir):
                shutil.rmtree(pred_dir)
            shutil.copytree(output_training_dir, pred_dir)
            self.status = 'collected'
            logger.info(repr(self))
            return (self._proc.returncode, error_msg)


The ``_is_submission_finished`` function
........................................

You need to implement the ``_is_submission_finished`` function to indicate the
worker that he can call the ``collect_results`` function. This function will
be dependent of the platform that you are using. For instance, for a conda
worker, it would look like::

      def _is_submission_finished(self):
        """Status of the submission.

        The submission was launched in a subprocess. Calling ``poll()`` will
        indicate the status of this subprocess.
        """
        return False if self._proc.poll() is None else True
